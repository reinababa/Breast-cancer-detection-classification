# Breast-cancer-detection-classification

Project workflow:
1. Framing the problem:
	- Cancer detection: Classification problem
	- Choose an evaluation metric: recall
	
2. Getting the data:
	- Use publicly available dataset: breast cancer (Wisconsin) dataset

4. Explore, prep and feature engineering:
 	 - Missing data (we remove one column with missing data)
 	 - Target class distribution
 	 - Features distribution, data types, and charachteristics
 	 - Feature correlation
 	 - PCA for dimensonality reduction
 	 - Feature scaling

5. Creating the model: 
 	 - Logistic regression and gridsearch CV to optimise hyperparameters
	  - Compare learning curves and cross validation score
	  - Select threshold for the highest recall (100%)

6. Presenting results:
 	 - Results: Confusion metrix highlighting recall and precision
 	 - Explaining the next steps and how the model will be used
